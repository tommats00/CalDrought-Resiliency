### Gap Analysis

### California Natural Resources Agency Website

-   

### Source Name

-   Has longitudinal values outside of California, only a few hundred not a big deal.

-   Contains over 9000 NAs in PWSID and ORG_ID columns, hard to connect source of water to its water agency

-   Latitude and Longitude doesn't contain a CRS

-   Problem with JOINing: Multiple sources for each ORG_ID which is how we will join the data with each water agency. Other dataframes have aggregated data for each ORG_ID per month, year, etc.

### Five year shortage

-   Columns: supply_augmentation and use_reduction have a lot of NAs, making it hard to interpret if actions were taken when shortage occurred.

-   This data is not truly "projected", it is data from the past with on average, 5 worst consecutive drought years.
